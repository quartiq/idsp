/// Type-II, sampled phase, discrete time PLL
///
/// This PLL tracks the frequency and phase of an input signal with respect to the sampling clock.
/// The open loop transfer function is I^2,I from input phase to output phase and P,I from input
/// phase to output frequency.
///
/// The transfer functions (for phase and frequency) contain an additional zero at Nyquist.
///
/// The PLL locks to any frequency (i.e. it locks to the alias in the first Nyquist zone) and is
/// stable for any gain (1 <= shift <= 30). It has a single parameter that determines the loop
/// bandwidth in octave steps. The gain can be changed freely between updates.
///
/// The frequency and phase settling time constants for a frequency/phase jump are `1 << shift`
/// update cycles. The loop bandwidth is `1/(2*pi*(1 << shift))` in units of the sample rate.
/// While the phase is being settled after settling the frequency, there is a typically very
/// small frequency overshoot.
///
/// All math is naturally wrapping 32 bit integer. Phase and frequency are understood modulo that
/// overflow in the first Nyquist zone. Expressing the IIR equations in other ways (e.g. single
/// (T)-DF-{I,II} biquad/IIR) would break on overflow (i.e. every cycle).
///
/// There are no floating point rounding errors here. But there is integer quantization/truncation
/// error of the `shift` lowest bits leading to a phase offset for very low gains. Truncation
/// bias is applied. Rounding is "half up". The phase truncation error can be removed very
/// efficiently by dithering.
///
/// This PLL does not unwrap phase slips accumulated during (frequency) lock acquisition.
/// This can and should be implemented elsewhere by unwrapping and scaling the input phase
/// and un-scaling and wrapping output phase and frequency. This then affects dynamic range,
/// gain, and noise accordingly.
///
/// The extension to I^3,I^2,I behavior to track chirps phase-accurately or to i64 data to
/// increase resolution for extremely narrowband applications is obvious.
